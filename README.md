## Functional Requirements

1. Course Recommendation: The system must provide course recommendations based on a user's academic progress, major, and career goals.
2. Generating Schedules: The Good Advisor should generate a comprehensive, semester-by-semester course schedule for users, taking into account course prerequisites.
3. Natural Language Chatbot: The chatbot must understand and respond to natural language queries related to course selection, prerequisites, and academic planning.
4. Internship and Career Guidance: The chatbot should provide information and resources related to internships, co-op programs, and career opportunities in the field of computer science.
5. Semester Load Analysis: The chatbot should help users maintain a balanced semester course load, taking into account credit hours, workload, and the importance of specific courses.

Non-Functional Requirements
    
1. Usability and User Experience: The web application must have an intuitive and user-friendly interface to cater to a diverse user base.
2. Compatibility and Browser Support: The web application should be compatible with a wide range of browsers and devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
3. Interoperability: If the chatbot integrates with external systems or databases, it should ensure smooth interoperability and data exchange with those systems.
4. Comprehensive Testing: Thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing, should be conducted to ensure the chatbot's reliability and functionality.
5. Response Language and Tone: It should adapt its language and tone to be informative and supportive, catering to the educational context.
